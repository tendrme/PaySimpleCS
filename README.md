.Net bindings for the v4 PaySimple API

This is a work in progress.  Almost the entire v4 API is bound with only the "New" and "Lookup" endpoints missing.  The binding is entirely generated from PaySimple's API spec along with some smart guessing done by the parser.  There are a few known bugs due to misdocumentation from PaySimple, and some limitations due to the binding's incompleteness, but this should go far to get you accomplishing most actions available from PaySimple.
